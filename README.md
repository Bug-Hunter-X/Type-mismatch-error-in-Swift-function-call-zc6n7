This example demonstrates a common type mismatch error in Swift.  The `calculateArea` function expects two integer arguments, but the function call attempts to provide a string as the second argument. This will cause a compiler error because the types do not match. The solution involves converting the string to an integer before passing it to the function.  This is a crucial concept in ensuring type safety within Swift.
